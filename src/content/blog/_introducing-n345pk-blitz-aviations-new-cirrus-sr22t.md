## Why the SR22T Matters

The Cirrus SR22T isn’t just another airplane, it’s an industry leader.

This isn’t just a step forward for Blitz Aviation, it’s a leap.

## A Perfect Fit for the Blitz Program

The SR22T’s arrival further strengthens our [Zero to Hero Program](/the-blitz-program/), our proprietary accelerated flight training pathway. Designed for motivated students aiming for private, commercial, or professional pilot certifications, The Blitz Program now gives participants access to a high-performance aircraft that mirrors what they’ll fly in real-world operations.

Its real-world avionics, impressive climb performance, and high-altitude capabilities are especially valuable for students preparing for complex aircraft endorsements or long cross-country flights.

Additionally, the Perspective+ avionics platform offers:

- Enhanced weather radar and terrain alerts
