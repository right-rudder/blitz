## ✈️ The Step-by-Step Pathway

### 🛫 **Private Pilot License (PPL) - Weeks 1–12**

The journey begins with the **Private Pilot License (PPL)**, which serves as the foundation of all flight training. Over the course of three months, students attend **2–3 training sessions per week**, covering essential skills like:

- Basic flight maneuvers
- Navigating controlled and uncontrolled airspace
- Emergency procedures and safety protocols
- Understanding weather conditions and flight planning
- Performing pre-flight inspections and mastering takeoff/landing techniques

Upon completion, students will have the competence to fly solo and with passengers, setting the stage for advanced training. You’ll learn to handle different types of aircraft and gain confidence in your piloting abilities through consistent practice and real-world scenarios.

### 🌐 **Instrument Rating (IR) - Weeks 13–20**

Next, you move on to earning your **Instrument Rating (IR)**. This two-month module sharpens your ability to fly in **low-visibility conditions** solely by reference to your instruments. Students fly **3–5 times per week**, mastering:

- Instrument approaches (ILS, VOR, GPS)
- Navigating through clouds and adverse weather
- Maintaining precise control and situational awareness
- Learning to interpret complex navigation instruments
- Practicing emergency scenarios under simulated conditions

Graduating from the IR phase means you're prepared to handle a wide range of weather scenarios safely and confidently. This phase also includes **cross-country flights** to build your navigation skills and prepare you for unpredictable weather conditions.

### ✈️ **Commercial Pilot License (CPL) - Weeks 21–28**

The final step in your journey is earning your **Commercial Pilot License (CPL)**. Over three months of intensive training (**3–5 sessions per week**), you will learn:

- Complex aircraft operations
- Advanced flight maneuvers (steep turns, stalls, emergency descents)
- Cross-country commercial navigation
- Precision landing techniques and power management
- Practical multi-engine training for enhanced career opportunities

This phase prepares you for the **FAA Practical Test**, where you will demonstrate mastery over all aspects of commercial aviation. Students will also practice **long-haul flights** and **night flying** to further sharpen their skills, ensuring they are well-rounded and capable of handling commercial duties.
