## ‚úàÔ∏è The Step-by-Step Pathway

### üõ´ **Private Pilot License (PPL) - Weeks 1‚Äì12**

The journey begins with the **Private Pilot License (PPL)**, which serves as the foundation of all flight training. Over the course of three months, students attend **2‚Äì3 training sessions per week**, covering essential skills like:

- Basic flight maneuvers

Upon completion, students will have the competence to fly solo and with passengers, setting the stage for advanced training. You‚Äôll learn to handle different types of aircraft and gain confidence in your piloting abilities through consistent practice and real-world scenarios.

### üåê **Instrument Rating (IR) - Weeks 13‚Äì20**

Next, you move on to earning your **Instrument Rating (IR)**. This two-month module sharpens your ability to fly in **low-visibility conditions** solely by reference to your instruments. Students fly **3‚Äì5 times per week**, mastering:

- Instrument approaches (ILS, VOR, GPS)
- Navigating through clouds and adverse weather
- Maintaining precise control and situational awareness

### ‚úàÔ∏è **Commercial Pilot License (CPL) - Weeks 21‚Äì28**
