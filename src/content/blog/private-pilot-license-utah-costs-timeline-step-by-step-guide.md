Whether you’re located in **Salt Lake City**, **Ogden**, **Davis County**, or **Weber County**, our flight training programs give you the skills and confidence to take to the skies.

## What Is a Private Pilot License?

A **Private Pilot License** allows you to operate single-engine aircraft and carry passengers for non-commercial purposes. It’s ideal for hobbyists, aspiring professional pilots, and anyone who wants to explore aviation.

## FAA Requirements to Get Your PPL

Before you begin training, it’s important to understand the basic **FAA eligibility requirements**:

- Be at least 17 years old
- Hold at least a **third-class FAA medical certificate**
- Be able to read, speak, and understand English
- Log a minimum of **40 flight hours** (most students require 50–70)
- Pass the FAA written knowledge test
- Pass the FAA practical test (checkride)

## Step-by-Step: How to Get Your Private Pilot License in Utah

### Step 1: Take a Discovery Flight

A discovery flight is your first hands-on flying experience. You’ll meet your instructor, take the controls, and get a real feel for what flight training is like.

### Step 2: Medical Certificate and Student Pilot Certificate

Schedule a medical exam with an FAA-authorized Aviation Medical Examiner. Blitz Aviation can help connect you with examiners in Northern Utah.

### Step 3: Enroll in Ground School

Ground school covers topics like aerodynamics, flight planning, airspace, weather, and FAA regulations. Students can choose in-person or online formats.

### Step 4: Begin Flight Lessons

You’ll train in **modern Cessna 172 and Piper Cherokee aircraft** equipped with advanced avionics. Lessons are scheduled flexibly to fit your lifestyle.

### Step 5: Solo Flight and Cross-Country Training

Once you meet proficiency standards, you’ll complete solo flights and cross-country trips under instructor supervision.

### Step 6: FAA Written Test and Checkride

You’ll take your FAA written knowledge test and complete your **practical test (checkride)** with a designated FAA examiner.

## Training Timeline

The timeline to get your PPL depends on your schedule, weather, and training frequency:
