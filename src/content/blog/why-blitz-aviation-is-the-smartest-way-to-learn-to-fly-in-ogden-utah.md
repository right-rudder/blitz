## What Makes Blitz Aviation Different?

### 1. **Straightforward Training That Saves Time**

Our flight training programs are designed to help you reach your goals as quickly as possible. No extra fluff. Just what you need to learn and pass your checkrides. Many of our students finish the Private Pilot License (PPL) in just 3 months, flying 2 to 3 times per week. Our Commercial Pilot program can be completed in 3 months as well.

### 2. **Affordable and Flexible**

We offer pay-as-you-go options with no hidden fees. Whether you train part-time or enroll in one of our accelerated flight programs, youâ€™ll know exactly what you're paying for. This makes flight training easier to budget, especially for students from Ogden, Salt Lake City, and surrounding areas.

### 3. **Real Instructors With Real Experience**

All of our flight instructors are certified and have logged hundreds of flight hours. Theyâ€™re focused on teaching practical skills, not just classroom knowledge. Youâ€™ll fly with instructors who care about your progress and give honest feedback every step of the way.

### 4. **Convenient Location at Ogden-Hinckley Airport (KOGD)**

Our school is located at Ogden-Hinckley Airport, just 35 minutes from Salt Lake City. This means easy access to controlled and uncontrolled airspace, giving you real-world experience with air traffic and radio communications. You'll also enjoy views of the Wasatch Front while learning in a focused environment.

### 5. **Zero-to-Hero Program**

Want to become a professional pilot? Our Zero-to-Hero program takes you from no experience to Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII). You can finish the full track in about 7 months if you train full-time. It's one of the fastest paths to a flying career in Utah.
