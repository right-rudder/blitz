  },
  {
    question: "What should I expect during a discovery flight?",
    answer:
      "You'll start with a brief ground session where your instructor explains basic aircraft controls and safety procedures. Then you'll do a pre-flight inspection together before taking off. Once airborne, you'll actually take the controls and experience the thrill of flying over the beautiful Ogden area and surrounding mountains.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any experience or preparation?",
    answer:
      "No experience is necessary! Just bring a valid photo ID and dress comfortably. Your instructor will guide you through everything step by step. We recommend avoiding heavy meals before flying and wearing closed-toe shoes.",

    question: "Can I bring a friend or family member?",
    answer:
      "Depending on the aircraft and weight considerations, we may be able to accommodate one additional passenger. Please let us know when booking if you'd like to bring someone along, and we'll check if it's possible for your specific flight.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the weather is bad?",
    answer:
      "Safety is our top priority. If weather conditions aren't suitable for flying, we'll reschedule your discovery flight at no charge. We'll contact you in advance if we need to reschedule due to weather.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the discovery flight count toward my training?",
    answer:
      "Yes! If you decide to pursue flight training with us, the time from your discovery flight can be logged toward your pilot's license requirements, making it both an introduction and a head start on your training.",

export const privatePilotFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What privileges come with a Private Pilot License?",
    answer:
      "With a Private Pilot License, you can fly single-engine aircraft for personal or recreational purposes, carry passengers (friends and family), fly cross-country to other airports, and rent aircraft from flight schools.

  {
    question: "What are the minimum flight hour requirements?",
    answer:
      "The FAA requires a minimum of 40 flight hours for a Private Pilot License, including at least 20 hours of flight training with an instructor and 10 hours of solo flight time. Most students actually need 60-80 hours total to be fully proficient and pass the checkride.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the checkride like?",
    answer:
      "The checkride consists of two parts: an oral exam and a practical flight test with an FAA Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE).

export const instrumentRatingFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What is an Instrument Rating?",
    answer:
      "An Instrument Rating (IR) allows you to fly in clouds and low visibility conditions using only the aircraft's instruments for navigation and control. This greatly increases your flying capabilities and safety margins, allowing you to fly in weather that would ground visual flight rule (VFR) pilots.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an Instrument Rating?",
    answer:
      "While not required for all flying, an Instrument Rating significantly increases your safety and capabilities as a pilot. It allows you to fly in marginal weather, provides better training in precision flying, and is required for most commercial pilot jobs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does Instrument Rating training take?",
    answer:
      "Most students complete their Instrument Rating in 3-6 months with regular training. Our accelerated 14-day program can get you certified much faster with intensive daily training. The minimum requirement is 40 hours of instrument time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between IFR and VFR flying?",
    answer:
      "VFR (Visual Flight Rules) flying relies on the pilot's ability to see and avoid obstacles and other aircraft. IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) flying uses instruments and air traffic control for navigation and separation, allowing flight in clouds and poor visibility conditions.",

export const commercialPilotFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What can I do with a Commercial Pilot License?",
    answer:
      "A Commercial Pilot License allows you to fly for compensation or hire. This opens up career opportunities such as flight instruction, charter flights, aerial photography, banner towing, pipeline patrol, and many other commercial aviation jobs. It's also a required step toward becoming an airline pilot.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the requirements for a Commercial Pilot License?",
    answer:
      "You must be at least 18 years old, hold a Private Pilot License and Instrument Rating, have at least 250 hours of flight time with specific experience requirements, pass a written exam, and complete a checkride with an FAA examiner.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does commercial pilot training take?",
    answer:
      "The timeline depends on your current experience and how quickly you can build the required 250 hours. The actual training for commercial maneuvers and procedures typically takes 2-4 months with regular training sessions.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What's the difference between commercial and private pilot training?",
    answer:
      "Commercial pilot training focuses on precision flying, advanced maneuvers, and higher standards of performance. You'll learn commercial maneuvers like chandelles, lazy eights, and steep spirals, along with more precise aircraft control and decision-making skills.",

export const cfiTrainingFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What does a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) do?",
    answer:
      "A CFI teaches student pilots how to fly, provides flight instruction for various certificates and ratings, endorses students for checkrides, and helps maintain flying proficiency for licensed pilots. It's a rewarding career that allows you to share your passion for aviation while building flight hours.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I become a flight instructor?",
    answer:
      "Becoming a CFI allows you to build flight hours while earning money doing what you love. It's excellent preparation for airline careers, as teaching flying makes you a better pilot. You'll also enjoy the satisfaction of helping others achieve their aviation dreams.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the requirements to become a CFI?",
    answer:
      "You must hold a Commercial Pilot License with Instrument Rating, have at least 250 hours of flight time, pass the CFI written exams (FOI and CFI), and complete a comprehensive checkride that tests both your flying skills and teaching ability.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does CFI training take?",
    answer:
      "CFI training typically takes 2-4 months, depending on your preparation and training frequency. The training focuses heavily on teaching techniques, learning to fly from the right seat, and mastering all the maneuvers you'll need to teach students.",

export const acceleratedProgramFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What are accelerated flight training programs?",
    answer:
      "Our accelerated programs are intensive training courses designed to get you certified in the shortest possible time. Instead of training 2-3 times per week over several months, you'll train daily for 10-14 days to complete your certification.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who are accelerated programs right for?",
    answer:
      "Accelerated programs are perfect for motivated students who can dedicate full-time to training, those with time constraints, career changers entering aviation, or pilots looking to quickly add ratings. They require full commitment but offer the fastest path to certification.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are accelerated programs more expensive?",
    answer:
      "While the daily cost is higher due to intensive training, accelerated programs often cost the same or less overall because they're more efficient. You'll use fewer total flight hours and complete training faster, potentially saving money compared to traditional part-time training.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I don't pass the checkride?",
    answer:
      "We have an excellent success rate, but if additional training is needed, we'll provide it at no extra charge until you're ready to pass. Our instructors work closely with each student to ensure thorough preparation before the checkride.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to arrange accommodations?",
    answer:
      "For out-of-town students, we can provide recommendations for local hotels and extended stay accommodations. Many students find it convenient to stay nearby during their intensive training period.",
