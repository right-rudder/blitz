      "Hands down the best put together flight school I’ve ever seen, blitz has been built about as good as a flight school can from the skyhawk 172 named Spartacus is leaps better than the planes I flew at my old school partly because they actually run. I love the atmosphere up at blitz with some amazing flying near the mountains, you can’t beat the scenery. Last but not least the check ride availability is nuts with world class instructors,Hats off to blitz.",

      "I’d like to start off with saying that I came into flying with Blitz Aviation completely blind. I decided to pull the trigger fly from California into Utah after talking to Mycah and feeling pretty good about the program they were running. I came with about 24 total hours trying to get chrckride ready with the least amount of hours possible so we did an accelerated style program. Lots of information was given to me but I already knew what I was getting myself into. From day one Mycah was the best. Ground work was amazing and explained so simple it was easy to understand. Flying wise the plane I flew for about 10 hours (N99832) was in tip top shape and you could tell they take care of their planes. The hanger/facility is beautiful and top notch. Im excited to be back in May to finish up my hours and get that chrckride done shortly after. Also no wait times for a DPE is basically unheard of.. unless you’re flying with Blitz they got you covered.",

      "When looking for a place to start my pilots license journey, it was difficult to find a place that I felt like I could trust, had a good community, a great fleet of aircraft, and instructors. Then, I found Blitz aviation and was blown away by not only there facilities, aircraft and staff they were welcoming and friendly in my journey to start my Private pilots license. Ruby, at the front desk is super sweet, efficient, and organized. Mycah and Andy are superb instructors and keep me learning at a fast but well tracked pace. I am looking forward to more hours in these well maintained aircraft. They have a space specifically designated for ground work too! It has been a pleasure to work with this family of aviation enthusiasts!!!! Let me not forget how they take away the stress of having to worry about getting a check-ride when I am prepared and ready! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to start a career or hobby in aviation, with a wide range of different aircraft or just to enjoy a discovery flight!",

      "I am currently flying with BLITZ to get my PPL and I can definitely say the energy of this place is so amazing and they have such a great staff that are always willing to answer questions or help you along your aviation journey! Mycah explains things in a way that just makes sense and always encourages trying again and improving. Mycah is my 2nd CFI and is leagues above my last. If you are looking at getting into aviation or even just furthering your skill set / knowledge I can’t recommend BLITZ enough!",
