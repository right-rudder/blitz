          A Journey from the Field to the Sky
        </h4>
        <p class="lg:text-lg tracking-wider font-light">
          Blitz Aviation was founded by Mycah Pittman with a simple mission: to
          make flight training accessible to everyone. Mycah’s journey to
          aviation started on the football field, where he played at the
          University of Oregon, Florida State, and Utah. After multiple
          surgeries sidelined his athletic career, he decided to take a
          discovery flight in 2024. That first solo flight sparked a passion for
          aviation, motivating him to pursue flying seriously.
        </p>
        <p class="lg:text-lg tracking-wider font-light">
          Even during his playing days, Mycah was so determined to learn that he
          would often fly right after games, using every opportunity to build
          his knowledge and improve his skills. Through hard work and
          dedication, he went from knowing nothing about aviation to confidently
          manipulating the controls and communicating effectively with ground
          and tower personnel. Now, his passion for flying has inspired his
          brother, Michael Pittman Jr, who is currently pursuing his Private
          Pilot’s License (PPL).
        </p>
        <p class="lg:text-lg tracking-wider font-light">
          At Blitz Aviation, Mycah brings that same drive and commitment to
          helping others achieve their aviation goals. Whether you're aiming for
          a private pilot’s license or a professional aviation career, we
          provide the training and support you need to succeed. Our programs
          focus on efficiency and hands-on learning, helping you build skills
          and confidence quickly. With personalized instruction, well-maintained
          aircraft, and a structured curriculum, we ensure you get the training
          you need to fly with confidence.
